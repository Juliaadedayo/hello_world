# hello_world
my first repository 
# Hi i'm Adedayo Temiloluwa

A medical student of the Niger Delta University, a ghost-writer and a software engineer in the making.

Sure sounds like a lot on my plate but yeah, I'm pushing it through and *who knows*

This is my first repository and I hope its good. Well, tell me what you think.
